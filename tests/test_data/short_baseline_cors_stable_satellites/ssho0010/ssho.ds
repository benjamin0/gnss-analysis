 DJ9210.Formal positional accuracy estimates are not available for this CORS
 DJ9210.because its coordinates were determined in part using modeled
 DJ9210.velocities. Approximate one-sigma accuracies for latitude, longitude,
 DJ9210.and ellipsoid height can be obtained from the short-term time series.
 DJ9210.Additional information regarding modeled velocities is available on
 DJ9210.the CORS Coordinates and Multi-Year CORS Solution FAQ web pages.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.The coordinates were established by GPS observations
 DJ9210.and adjusted by the National Geodetic Survey in February 2012.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.NAD 83(2011) refers to NAD 83 coordinates where the reference 
 DJ9210.frame has been affixed to the stable North American Tectonic Plate. 
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.The coordinates are valid at the epoch date displayed above
 DJ9210.which is a decimal equivalence of Year/Month/Day.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.The orthometric height was determined by differential leveling and
 DJ9210.adjusted by the NATIONAL GEODETIC SURVEY
 DJ9210.in April 2008.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.No vertical observational check was made to the station.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.Significant digits in the geoid height do not necessarily reflect accuracy.
 DJ9210.GEOID12B height accuracy estimate available here.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.The PID for the CORS L1 Phase Center is DN5855.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.The XYZ, and position/ellipsoidal ht. are equivalent.
 DJ9210
 DJ9210.The ellipsoidal height was determined by GPS observations
 DJ9210.and is referenced to NAD 83.
